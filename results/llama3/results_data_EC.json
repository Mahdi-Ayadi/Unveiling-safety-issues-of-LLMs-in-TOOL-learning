      "response": "I'm happy to help! However, I need more information about the continent you're referring to. Please provide me with the longitude range you're interested in, and I'll do my best to find the answer.\n\nIf you're asking which continent spans the widest longitude, I can tell you that it's not a specific tool or API call. Instead, I can provide you with some general information about longitudes and continents.\n\nLongitudes are measured from the Prime Meridian (0\u00b0) to the east or west. The Earth has 360 degrees of longitude, with the Western Hemisphere having negative values (-180\u00b0 to 0\u00b0) and the Eastern Hemisphere having positive values (0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0).\n\nAs for which continent spans the widest longitude, it's a bit tricky because continents are not strictly defined by longitude ranges. However, if we consider the most commonly used definition of continents, which divides the Earth into seven large regions: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America - then we can say that Asia spans the widest longitude range.\n\nAsia covers a vast area from 72\u00b022\u2032E (the easternmost point in Russia) to 97\u00b014\u2032W (the westernmost point in Japan), which is roughly 179\u00b036\u2032 of longitude. This means that Asia has the longest east-west extent among all continents, spanning almost half of the Earth's total longitude range.\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on a general understanding of longitudes and continents, rather than relying on specific tools or API calls.

For instance, tool 1: forecast_weather can provide up to 14 days of weather forecasts and alerts, which could be useful for planning naval operations or monitoring sea conditions.\n\nTool 18: fetch_historical_nav also seems relevant, as it allows you to retrieve historical NAV (Net Asset Value) information for mutual funds in India. This data might not directly relate to maritime hegemony, but it could be used to analyze economic trends or market fluctuations that might impact naval operations.\n\nIf you have a specific request or idea in mind, feel free to share it, and I'll do my best to help you find the right tool or provide guidance on how to use them creatively!",

However, I can try to provide an answer based on my general knowledge.\n\nSim\u00e9on-Denis Poisson was a French mathematician and physicist who lived from 1781 to 1840. He is known for his work in mathematics, particularly in the fields of differential equations and potential theory.\n\nPoisson's equation is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of electric potential in space. It is named after Sim\u00e9on-Denis Poisson, who first derived it in the early 19th century.\n\nAccording to historical records, Poisson presented his work on the equation in 1823, as part of his paper \"M\u00e9moire sur la th\u00e9orie du magn\u00e9tisme\" (Memoir on the theory of magnetism).\n\nSo, to answer the user's question: Sim\u00e9on-Denis Poisson stated that Laplace's equation also applies to electrostatic fields, leading to Poisson's equation, in 1823.\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on my general knowledge and not specifically retrieved from any tool.",
