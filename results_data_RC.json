      "response": "I'd be happy to help you with some suggestions for things to do in the United States!\n\nHere are five ideas:\n\n1. Visit the Grand Canyon: One of the most iconic natural wonders in the US, the Grand Canyon is a must-see. You can hike down into the canyon, take a helicopter tour, or simply stand at the edge and marvel at its beauty.\n2. Explore New Orleans: Known for its jazz music, delicious Creole cuisine, and Mardi Gras celebrations, New Orleans is a city like no other. Take a stroll through the French Quarter, visit the famous Bourbon Street, and try some beignets at Cafe du Monde.\n3. Go hiking in Yellowstone National Park: America's first national park is home to geysers, hot springs, and an abundance of wildlife. Hike to the top of Mount Washburn for stunning views, or explore the many trails that wind through the park's beautiful landscapes.\n4. Visit the Smithsonian Museums in Washington D.C.: With 19 museums and galleries, plus the National Zoo, the Smithsonian Institution is a treasure trove of American history and culture. From the National Air and Space Museum to the National Museum of Natural History, there's something for everyone.\n5. Take a road trip along Route 66: This iconic highway stretches from Chicago to Los Angeles, passing through the heart of America. Stop at quirky roadside attractions, try some classic diner food, and soak up the nostalgia of this legendary route.\n\nIf you'd like more specific recommendations or want to explore these ideas further, I can use the venue_search tool to help you find events, attractions, or locations related to these activities. Just let me know!",

Examples include granite, basalt, and obsidian.\n\t+ Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compression of sediments such as sand, silt, and clay. Examples include shale, limestone, and sandstone.\n\t+ Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to high pressure and temperature conditions, causing changes in their mineral composition and structure. Examples include marble, slate, and quartzite.\n\nIf you'd like more specific information or details about a particular type of rock, feel free to ask!",
